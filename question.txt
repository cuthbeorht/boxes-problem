Boxes of units need to be loaded in a truck. 

In the programming language of your choice, write a function that will compute the maximum number of units that can be loaded in a truck, given the capacity of the truck in boxes and a list of box kind descriptions having the number of available boxes and the number of units per box for each kind. 

Input:  

  - boxKinds (available, unitsPerBox) = [ 

    [1, 3], [2, 2], [3, 1] 

  ] 

  - truckSize = 4 

Output: 8 

Input:  

  - boxKinds (available, unitsPerBox) = [ 

    [5, 10], [2, 5], [4, 7], [3, 9] 

  ] 

  - truckSize = 10 

Output: 91
